    Output shell completion code for the specified shell (bash or zsh)
description: |-
    Output shell completion code for the specified shell (bash or zsh). The shell code must be evaluated to provide interactive completion of iamctl commands.  This can be done by sourcing it from the .bash_profile.

     Detailed instructions on how to do this are available here: http://github.com/marmotedu/iam/docs/installation/iamctl.md#enabling-shell-autocompletion

     Note for zsh users: [1] zsh completions are only supported in versions of zsh >= 5.2
